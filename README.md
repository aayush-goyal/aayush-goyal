## Other Works

👨🏻‍💻 I am also a full-stack developer primarily working in the Android and Web (React) space. I recently developed an interest in designing and have been teaching myself UI/UX and Graphics designing since last year. Apart from this, the business world entices me. I love the field so much that everything involved from fundraising to IPOs, product-market fit to marketing, I want to learn and grow in each one of them.

🥷🏼 I am also a freelancer @ [Akhada](https://akhada.co/). I majorly work on their website designs and React front-end development. Akhada is one-stop solution for learning anything new. Do checkout our work.

## Personal

📚 I love reading and have devoured 70+ novels since 2016. I boast about this fact because I used to be someone who hated reading. Now reading takes up a pretty heft amount of my daily routine.<br>
💪🏼 I also try to keep my body in shape and working out is a part of my daily routine. You might also find me fighting for my team when I am playing a team sport or fighting for myself when I am playing an individual sport.
