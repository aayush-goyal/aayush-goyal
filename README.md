Hi 👋🏼 <br />
I am Aayush Goyal from India 🇮🇳.

⏱ With a solid foundation of over 5 years in the dynamic tech industry, predominantly within the FinTech domain, I ventured into the realm of product management, steering my journey full-time with my start-up in January 2021.

🎓 Graduating from NIT Srinagar has taught me a few important life skills, notably resilience amidst challenges. I have applied this same principle throughout my career so far.

🏗️💻 I have worked and experience on the following technologies:<br />
**Languages**: • TypeScript • JavaScript (ES6) • Dart • Kotlin • HTML5 • CSS3 • Java<br />
**Front-end**: • Next.js (React.js) • Flutter • SASS • CSS Modules • Styled Components • styled-jsx<br />
**Resting**: • Jest • Testing Library • Playwright <br />
**Back-end**: • Express.js (Node.js) • REST APIs • GraphQL<br />
**Library**: • react-query • zustand • Browser APIs • ESLint<br />
**DBs**: • MongoDB • Cloud Firestore<br />
**Cloud**: GCP, Firebase<br />
**IDEs**: VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA <br />
**Tools**: • Git • GitHub • Figma • GitHub Actions • Miro • Retool <br />

🏆 In my tenure as the founder of deriva, I made democratizing personal finance for Indians my end goal. I honed my product skills by teaching myself all the essential skills like UX Research, PDLC, and Stakeholder Management, and leveraging existing skills in Agile, SDE, and Leadership to deliver 2 MVPs (one with pivot). This was also when I truly learned the art of networking and used it to my advantage. My major achievements were raising funds from friends & family, and conducting thorough market and user research to understand the market space and business.

🌟 Then I joined 50Fin as a founding member. It was truly transformative. I wrote code, hired initial founding team members, collaborated on the initial product vision, and delivered an MVP with the product team in under 4 months. Additionally, I oversaw marketing to increase brand awareness, and stocked pantry items!

🛠️ After taking a career break, I joined Pickright as the sole Product Manager. Leading a team of 14 members was challenging but we successfully delivered 30 features in under 5 months which 1. scaled the product to handle 1 million users, 2. made our product designs coherent and easy for users, 3. reduced daily bugs count by 70% and made the product stable, 4. delivered a few internal tools to collaborate with cross-functional teams, and 5. improved team efficiency by 20%.

📚 In my downtime, I indulge in diverse activities - whether absorbing knowledge through reading, engaging in sports, crafting DIY projects, or playing bartender for friends and family.

## Personal

📚 I love reading and have devoured 90+ novels since 2016. I boast about this fact because I used to be someone who hated reading. Now reading takes up a pretty heft amount of my daily routine.<br>
💪🏼 I also try to keep my body in shape and working out is a part of my daily routine. You might also find me fighting for my team when I am playing a team sport or fighting for myself when I am playing an individual sport.
